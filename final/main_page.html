				<h1>Senior Summer in KL</h1>
				<h2>June 6 ~ July 15</h2>
				<p>
					June 14: Ice Skating at Kiara 163 with the Lang group and Sergio. Became pretty decent at skating since I've been on the same track for a while now. First time eating at kbbq at Saemaeul, was handed the task of cooking the meat along with Sergio as the fellow "Koreans". Went to the Ark after. 
				</p>
				<p>
					June 16: Aoi made me follow her to the Korean embassy because she was "too scared". The whole process took around 30 to 45 minutes where I just waited inside an air-conditioned room. Took a grab back to Mont' Kiara where Aoi bought brunch at this fancy cafe. Spent around 3 hours discussing about Mei. 
				</p>
				<p>
					June 21: Finally meeting as a whole group with the gang while eating Hotpot at Solaris. We didn't do much except go Karaoke and go to a new bar afterwards. Me and KC refused to drink because it was way too expensive.

				<h1>Senior Summer in Seoul</h1>
				<h2>July 16 ~ August 12</h2>
				<p>
					July 22: Met up with my old boy SeungEun at his place in Gangnam. He had changed a lot since I met him last time, which was around the new year 2020. He had slimmed down a considerable amount, first unable to recognize him. We ate some galbi together, and then we went to his house played some video games, ate ice cream, and did some karaoke. Late at night, we went to go eat late night food together. 
				</p>
				<p>
					July 27: Got a haircut and met up with my boy Heon. It'd been a long time since I met him and we went to go eat lunch together and did some karaoke and some shady place but the owner was a nice man. 
				</p>
				<p>
					August 2: KC and Kyle both came to Korea and I met up with them on a rainy day. We took some photos together and headed towards a kbbq place to meet up with HJ and Aoi as well.
