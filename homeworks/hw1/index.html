        <p> Hi, my name is Jinwoo and I'm a freshman currently studying at Berkeley. I love to do a lot of different activities whether it be sports like golf, or games like Valorant.
            I'm excited to learn web design and development this semester! </p>

            <li> Something that I've learned from reading the article is how design is incorporated into apps or websites. For instance, in Spotify, the songs are kept in view. This is most likely to keep the user interacted and wanting them to keep engaging</li>
            <li>My favourite part of the article is the start and the end of the article where it lays out the 4 main points in analyzing a design: hierarchy, content, intent, audience. </li>
