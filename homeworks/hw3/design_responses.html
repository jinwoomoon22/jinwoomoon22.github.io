						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that text, or typography, is a way in which the author or creator can communictae with the audience. If the designer or creator uses font while considering the audience as well as the message the designer wants to convey, can create a more meaningful message and passes on the message better to the audience. In addition to fonts, the sizing of the texts are also important as it creates hierarchy or salience in the audience's eyes.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was when the article explained about the font size ratios. I never really thought about ratios but I've considered what looks good in my eyes. I think if I utilize this knowledge in the future, it would help me be a better communicator as a developer.  </p>
