                            <p> I learned that there are multiple ways of expressing transitions. Also, there are a multitude of different elements used in these transitions, such as gifs, and pictures but with transitions. I think that using a balance of these well would create a good product for the user.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was looking at the different designs and how each brand/company utilizes these different techniques to effectively showcase their products or their brand. I also liked how they all seemed very different in the techniques used depending on the company and their purpose.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked the travel map, especially because of the color contrast between the map and the route. I think that this really helped me get a good sense of visualistaion as a third person of the selected route from current location to destination. Although I thought the texts breaking when the search got more specific was a little bothersome, I liked that they put an effort into the design so that it sets them apart from regular search bars. </p>

                            <p> 7, as I liked seeing all the different designs and techniques used, catering to their products and specific situations.</p>
