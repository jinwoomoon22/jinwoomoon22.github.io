							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think the article was interesting, as it touches on the psychology of a human and in what order we do things or grabs our attention. What interested me the most was the picture of the stages of information processing: attention directing, short term memory, working memory, motor programmes. Another interesting aspect that I've learned here is the Hick's law where there seems to be a logarithmic relationship between time and the number of choices given. This didn't really change my influence as it was my first time learning this but I feel like I would be more wary next time I see a multiple choice question on an exam. </p>
