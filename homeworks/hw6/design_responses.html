					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there are certain procedures we should follow with UX animation. Tablets and mobile phones have different optimal animation durations, which is interesting but also understandable as both generally have different size screens. I also learned that size plays a part in the animation speed or duration. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was learning about which animation speed/time is good for each use. For example, researchers believe that optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 to 500 ms, due to qualities of the human brain. Also, depending on what the animations are, for example, hover or fading, it should be a lot faster animation than other types of animations implemeneted. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Objects that are not affected by any physical force move linearly, in other words with constant speed. And just because of this fact they look very unnatural and artificial for the human eye." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
